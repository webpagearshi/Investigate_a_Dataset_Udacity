# Investigate_a_Dataset_Udacity
> In this report I am analysing TMDB Movie Dataset. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies like the title, cast, popularity, budget, revenue, Director, runtime, genres, production house, release date,vote_count etc. I will be using this dataset to answer a few questions.

- Which year has the highest number of movie releases? Which year has the lowest number of movie releases? How has the trend of movies released per year changed over the years?
- Which movies have the shortest and longest runtimes?
- The top 10 movies which made the highest profit?
- Which genre are more profitable than others?
- Is there a corelation between budget and profit?

> This project is a part of the Udacity coursework.
